# T-20 WorldCup Cricket Data Analytics - Cricket Analysis [Python | Web Scraping | Pandas | PowerBI]
 - Created a Power BI report to identify top-11 players for a T-20 Cricket team by scraping data from espncricinfo with a Bright Data website tool, cleaning and transforming data with pandas and evaluating various player performance metrics.
 - Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (opener, middle-order/anchor, finisher, all-rounders, specialist fast-bowler) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play the match.
 - Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has 90% chances to win the game.
